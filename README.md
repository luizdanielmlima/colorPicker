# Color Picker

I made this app to learn some Sass, so I came up with this idea of a color picker, where the colors are generated with the @for. I also learned to use @mixin, @extend and @include.

## Some Observations

- I think mixins are the best feature in Sass, very powerful!
- Clipboard.js is very useful and simple to use.
- If you want better color generators in the internet, I suggest [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/).

Best regards,
